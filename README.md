# SQLChallenge
Introduction to SQL 

Overview 
In this project, I will design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. The data is 6 CSV files from the company containing people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
